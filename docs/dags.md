# Directed Acyclic Graphs

> The version history of a distributed revision control system, such as Git,
> generally has the structure of a directed acyclic graph, in which there is a
> vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were
> directly derived from each other. These are not trees in general due to merges
